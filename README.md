## <div align="center">🚀 About Me 🚀</div>
<div align="center">👨‍💻 I'm a Frontend Web Developer Junior. 👨‍💻</div>
<div align="center">🎓 Also I'm the valedicotrian for the class 2022 of the vocational school of Electical Engineering Nikola Tesla in Belgrade. 🎓</div>
<div align="center">😱 I'm amazed with web and the whole Internet world. 😱</div>
<div align="center">😊 My dream is to become a Full Stack Web Developer. 😊</div>

## <div align="center">📜 My Story 📜</div>

<div align="justify">I got in touch with computer technologies in my vocational
school for the first time. Firstly, I got familiar with 
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel as well as software and hardware 
in theory. In the second grade, I started to learn C. Soon, 
we transferred to C++ and that's the time I learned the core 
concepts of programming. Then, we began to make static web 
pages in HTML and pure CSS. That's where my fascination 
started. 😲</div>
<br />
<div align="justify">When we began adding dynamic elements to our 
static web pages using JavaScript, I knew that I had fallen 
in love with the web. Later, I was watching videos on various 
topics on my own, such as clean code, functional programming, 
testing, security, and so on, whilst I was learning Rasor 
Pages with C# in my school, but I have to say we were not 
learning Backend Web Development in-depth. Previously, we 
learned all about databases (creating database, modifying 
data and lot more). We were learning MySQL. 💻</div>
<br />
<div align="justify">Now, I have a 
strong knowledge of HTML, pure CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, 
and I'm currently learning React alongside Tailwind CSS. My 
plans for the future are to extend my knowledge by learning 
Node.js and become a Full Stack Web Developer. ✨</div>
